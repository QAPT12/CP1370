# CP1370
# **Distributed Computing**

Welcome to my **Distributed Computing Course** repository! This repo contains labs from the course CP1370 and my journey into **big data processing**.

## **Course Focus**
- **Big Data Concepts**: Understanding how to process and analyze massive datasets efficiently.  
- **MapReduce**: Implementing distributed computing techniques for large-scale data processing.  
- **Apache Spark**: Leveraging Sparkâ€™s powerful framework for real-time and batch data analysis.  

## **Technologies Used**
- **Hadoop & MapReduce**  
- **Apache Spark (PySpark, Spark SQL, Spark Streaming)**  
- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**  

This repository serves as a reference for key concepts and code samples.
